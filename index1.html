        <h3>Why I chose CSE?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I took this department because this is the only safest department according to the societ. 
            I am a person who is loved coding. 
            This field gave me the confidence that at least I will become a programmer or web developer. 
            I know this sounds hilarious but on the serious note Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) provides you the best career opportunities. 
            So, this was the only reason I took CSE.</p>

              <h3>My Favourite Pasttimes</h3>
              <p>
                    Watching Movies & Tv Series. I watch movies when i was free , either in the background to relax, or right up front and 
                    loud to enjoy it if nothing else is going on. I even have it playing while I’m doing something one the phone, 
                 and I can actually concentrate better.
                    This is just a recent development, though, which is weird. Also, I used to rarely listen to music, 
                    except for playing classical music on the piano and sometimes every so often listening to it.
                </p>
